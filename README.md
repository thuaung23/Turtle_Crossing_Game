# This program utilizes Turtle module and is written in OOP. 
# A player can control the (up and down) movement of a turtle 
  to move across constantly moving objects(cars). 
# If the turtle reaches finish line, the player's level increases by 1. 
# If the turtle collides with any of the moving objects, the game is instantly over.
# The score is displayed at the upper left corner.
